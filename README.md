# HeadsUP

## Inspiration
We wanted to create an interactive game where new drivers can learn about essential driving and traffic rules.

## What it does
HeadsUp is an interactive game designed to educate new drivers about important driving practices and traffic rules. Players will have the chance to learn about essential driving rules during the game and receive feedback for improvements. We based the rules of our game on the MVD Driving Manual.

## How we built it
We built the game using unity and coded in C#.

## Challenges we ran into
We ran into challenges when creating the "world" (setting and environment) for the game. Since we wanted to create an interactive and engaging game, we had to spend quite some time on finding the best environment to demonstrate the rules. We also had to find and incorporate various traffic signs and scale them so they fit naturally on the landscape.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were able to effectively develop a game, where players can learn about driving/traffic rules by playing the game.

## What we learned
We learned about different C# functions and unity navigation skills. Most importantly, we learned new, effective team working skills to ensure we successfully build a deliverable project on time.

## What's next for HeadsUp
We want to continue improving the game by adding more features and incorporate less common but still important driving practices and rules by creating more scenes. We also wish to add a first-person view (in the driver's seat) to make the game even more engaging.
